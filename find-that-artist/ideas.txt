Code is currently really slow

Can we work on playlists as we get them instead of waiting until all playlists are grabbed

alternatively, can we preprocess the songs in the plyalist by adding them to the dictionary with the singer's name?
    doesn't work faster than the first but works if you're doing it multiple times. means you only need to process the list of songs once
